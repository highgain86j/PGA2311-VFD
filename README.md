PGA2311-VFD
===========
This repository contains a work-in-progress project. The aim is to write codes for an Arduino board with a B-curve VR as a potentiometer, of which the output is to be converted to digital.
The converted voltage (now in digital format) is than scaled down 0-255 to be fed into a PGA2311.
